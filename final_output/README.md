### **Code Q&A**
**Q**: Why you chose that algorithm(efficiency, CPU, RAM)?  
**A**: I chose the brute force algorithm, to check fast if my approach to the problem is correct. I know that time complexity of this solution is O(n^2) where
   n is number of points.

**Q**: Do you obtain the same order as you obtained qualitatively by eye with CloudCompare?  
**A**: My quantitative score confirmed my initial rating using CloudCompare.

**Q**: Why designed the code as it is?  
**A**: I designed the code thinking about its easier expansion.

**Q**: If you had more time or computing resources, how would you improve the results?  
**A**: I would focus on ordering points algorithm. I would implement the divide and conquere method, which should give the O($nlog(n)$) time complexity.


### **Data analysis Q&A**
**Q**: How do the 3 compressions ranks?  
**A**: I evaluated the compression methods based on average distance between points, maximum distance and absolute difference between reflectivity values.  
   I mainly took into account the average distance between the points. The differences in reflectivity values were the same in A & B methods.  
   The visualization of the plots made me sure about the ranking.
